Spotify's Top 10 Artists by Country

What is it?

A geochart where each country shows a list of today's Top 10 Artists by total number of plays on Spotify.

How does it work?

Python's BeautifulSoup library is used to scrape latest top played songs by country from spotifycharts.com. 
The data is then used to determine the top 10 artists by calculating the sum of all streams using the first fifty 
positions out of the Top 200. Today's top 10 highest streamed artists are Spotify's Top 10 Artists by Country. 
Google Charts is then used to create a geochart and visualize each country and see their respective Top 10 lists.
